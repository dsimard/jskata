# jskata is OBSOLETE 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dsimard/jskata.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dsimard/jskata)

jskata is now __obsolete__. All the parts have been moved to other projects.

## _jskata.timezone_ is now [timezonedetect](https://github.com/dsimard/timezonedetect)

Detect the standard time, the daylight saving time for the current time zone at <https://github.com/dsimard/timezonedetect>

## _jskata.undo_ is now [undone](https://github.com/dsimard/undone)

Do, undo and redo library for javascript at <https://github.com/dsimard/undone>

__jskata.nofreeze__ is still in jskata but is not a really interesting project anyway.

## Why obsolete?

I wanted _jskata_ to be a suite of javascript libraries but I finally tear them apart because :

- The libraries had no link together
- It was hard to write a clear documentation
- It was hard to understand for the users
- It was hard to contribute
- I didn't know which project was interesting for the users and which I should improve
